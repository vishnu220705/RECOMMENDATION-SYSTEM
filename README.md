#DESCRIPTION: My fourth task is Recommendation System, where I built a model to suggest relevant items based on user preferences and past interactions. I implemented this using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to improve recommendation accuracy. I uploaded the data file and executed the model in Google Colab, ensuring proper data preprocessing, feature extraction, and evaluation. The system analyzes user behavior patterns to provide personalized recommendations. To maintain proper documentation and version control, I uploaded the code to GitHub, along with relevant outputs showcasing the recommendation results. This task helped me understand similarity measures, matrix factorization, and deep learning-based recommendation techniques. Running the implementation in Google Colab allowed me to efficiently utilize cloud resources, and by storing everything on GitHub, I ensured easy access, collaboration, and tracking of modifications for future improvements and debugging.
